The internet has brought about unprecedented change in society, spanning the entire globe and crossing all boundaries. The Internet has redefined the methods of communication, education, health, and commerce, etc. Agricultural E-commerce enables good trading possibilities by supporting different business models such as multi-suppliers, e-sales, and several types of auctions. Todayâ€™s E-commerce lacks fully automated business processes and still requires a significant manual effort by users.
The way people go about purchasing agricultural products is of great concern. Sometimes they have to travel far distances to obtain these products and unfortunately, sometimes the products may not be in stock. Also, the quality of the products is not guaranteed, especially the perishables. In case of any problems, the buyer cannot complain to the sellers or producer of the product.
 Also, various market prices cannot be compared because buyers do not have the time and resources to be visiting all agric farms. This problem can be solved if there was an electronic means of trading using a multi-agent system approach.
An agent is an entity that is designed to undertake autonomous action on behalf of a user in pursuit of his desired goal. This implies that agents are intelligent and autonomous objects that are capable of behaving like human beings. Therefore agent technology is a suitable means for expanding agricultural business activities and saving costs.
